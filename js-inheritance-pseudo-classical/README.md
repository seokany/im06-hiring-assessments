## Pseudo-classical inheritance
* [ ] Refactor `makePhone` and `makeSmartphone` to use pseudo-classical inheritance
  * They should have all of the same methods as objects returned from the original maker functions provided
  * _Do not modify the factory functions - instead, use the constructor functions at the end of the file_
