## Underscore
  * [ complete] Implement an `each()` function that works like underscore's each helper
    * Must handle passed-in arrays, objects, and strings as input values.
  * [complete ] Using `each`, implement `filter()`
    * `filter()` returns an array of all the elements in the original collection that pass a truth test.
    * The first argument to `filter()` is a collection
    * The second argument is an iterator function, used as the truth test.
    * Example: `filter([3,4,5,6], function(number){ return number % 2; })` returns `[3,5]`
